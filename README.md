# ember-a11y-roadmap
Roadmap for all things a11y in ember.js

List of things we will attempt to improve: 

- the way routing works with screen readers
- focus management
- modals
- keyboard navigation
- [linting](linting.md) 
- guides & developer education
- semantic test helpers (improves code in general but could specifically be used to better test for accessibility conformance)


## RFCs that exist: 
- [accessible routing in Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/433)
- [semantic test helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/327)
