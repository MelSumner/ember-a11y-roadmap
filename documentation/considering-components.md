Components are an important part of a successful web application, especially when that application needs to scale. 

We have seen enough data to know that the old adage, "if it builds, it works" is no longer a viable approach for applications. It was never really a viable approach, but now we know absolutely for sure that it does not result in long-lasting, accessible products for consumers and increased costs for businesses who have not been properly advised to know better. 

It's not just enough to think about the components we should be providing adequate patterns for (and we will define that shortly), it's also necessary to arm developers so they are no longer at the mercy of unwitting product owners, un-educated designers or left up to their own devices. We _must_ also provide guidance about what patterns may be requested and why they should be avoided or outright refused. We should not only provide the well-lit path, but also build a body of data that demonstrates not only that dangers _exist_ in the shadows, but what those shadows are. 

It is an accurate statment to say that every feature in a web application can be implemented in JavaScript. JavaScript has made nearly everything possible- it is therefore the ultimate responsibility of web engineers to use that power judiciously and only when needed. It is not enough to know how to implement _anything_ the language allows, but how and when to use it to implement something _well_. 

When considering how to improve components in general, a few considerations come to mind: 

- developer experience
- end-user experience 
- performance
- accessibility
- business value proposition

We need a better way to balance all of these things- a difficult task to be sure, but not an impossible one. 

Stay tuned.
