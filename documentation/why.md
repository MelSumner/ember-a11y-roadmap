# Why we would do this

By improving the types of documented support available to developers, we will be able to better integrate accessibility into the developer's default workflow, instead of being an after-thought. 

This should increase developer efficiency. 

There may be some areas where it will not appear to pay off at first- in fact, in the case of moving accessibility into the developer workflow in the linting aspect, this may initially decrease developer productivity while they are getting used to it. However, experience has shown that developers adapt to expectations, and clear, concise linting and error messaging with supporting documentation will make all the difference.
