## A11y in Ember Guides

We intend to add basic/essential accessibility practices to the Ember.js guides. 

- add A11y as a section of the guides
- add sub-sections
  - foundations/overview
  - design
  - code
  - content
  - additional resources
- add appropriate a11y to the guides code sample content

## A11y in tutorial content

Instead of providing separate accessibility training, existing Ember training should be evaluated for the following: 

- where could A11y exercises be included to flow naturally with existing content?
- where could the content reasonably discuss A11y to ensure that developers understand it's importance?

Current tutorials should be audited, and updates should be provided.
