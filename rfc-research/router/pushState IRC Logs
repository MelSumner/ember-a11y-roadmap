thanks to discussion with smaug____, I think I've found a good reason to believe that fixing :target selectors to update upon history.pushState() is unlikely to break any webapps
19:42laughinghan
which is that currently after pushState, though :target selectors aren't updated, if you then hit Back and then Fwd, the :target rules will apply
19:44laughinghan
smaug____: oh, your idea that pushState() should also dispatch hashchange?
19:46laughinghan
therefore, pushState should fire hashchange after window.location and history.state have been updated

annevk: want to do a sanity check? push/replaceState html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#dom-history-pushstate don't seem to care at all whether the current entry is actually for the document for which the history object was created. I mean a case when one takes a reference to a history object and then navigates browser context to some other page, yet uses the old history object

annevk: that means request.client.url wouldn't reflect changes made by pushState… *ponders on if that's a good or bad thing*
16:44JakeA
annevk: if I got a push message, I wouldn't show a notification if a relevant tab was focused & visible. For this case, pushState matters, I want the "location bar" url. For clients.takeControl(), if we go by post-pushState url, you get a weird edge-case where documents that were originally loaded out-of-scope could become controlled, so creationURL feels

or rather, they work on the initial url, but if you use history.pushState(), it no longer works
21:43caitp
oh no, it is still doing something weird, at least in webkit/blink, basically if you pushState() and then cause the SVG to be re-rendered in some fashion, it gets it wrong, weird

I remember a long time ago reading an interview with Hixie where he was talking about all the vestigial things. I think the useless pushState argument was near the top of his list? Anyway it was refreshing honesty for someone new to all this.
20:30Domenic_
"... which leads to APIs that make no sense, like pushState(), which has a required argument that is ignored."
20:38zewt
if it was guaranteed to be ignored, i could say pushState(null, null, url) instead of pushState(null, document.title, url) ... 95% of the time the URL is all I want to change anyway

Hixie: question about PopStateEvent.state: is it meant to behave differently whether it was created via history.pushState() or new PopStateEvent()?
21:56aklein
Hixie: the spec says (non-normatively) that state 'Returns a copy of the information that was provided to pushState() or replaceState().'; but normatively, it also says 'The state attribute must return the value it was initialized to. '

in fact I think people may even prefer sometimes using something like this over pushState() even when network is available as it makes it much easier to separate server and client logic

Hixie: I am a real user and I have personally constructed systems to do this for real world use cases. It is useful in conjunction with pushState.
19:47zewt
how, concretely, is it useful with pushState?
19:48zewt
(i've used pushState extensively; I give it relative URLs, and it pushes a resolved absolute URL)
19:59dsheets
Hixie: the same source is served for all subpaths and the display is switched in JS to accomodate pushState
20:02dsheets
Hixie: your question is "why are there multiple subpaths in your single-page pushState-using web app?"? Is that accurate? Why not?
20:05dsheets
Hixie: How do I have one URL for multiple resources? Doesn't pushState allow me to design my URI scheme in a way that keeps distinct resources distinct?

16 Aug 2012
#whatwg
01:05Hixie
you mean pushState()?
01:06Hixie
pushState() won't be used to make fragids disappear except for cases where the server knows how to generate pages for each url (e.g. how g+ does)
01:21zewt
rather not nice that the spec allows ignoring pushState for non-user-actions
01:27zewt
i have pages that eg. show a login prompt, on click send an XHR login request, and don't pushState until the login request succeeds
01:51Hixie
yeah using pushstate and then replacestate later seems like the best option

Hmm, so I am confused about base URIs + pushState. If I have <base href="base/"><a href="foobar"></a> and I pushState the URL of the link, what should the a) document location, b) document base URL and c) resolved link URL be after the pushState?
09:07jgraham
TC: hoppipolla.co.uk/tests/pushState/001.html
09:11jgraham
In particular I don't quite follow why the document base URI doesn't change (in Wecko/GeKit) when you pushState
09:28jgraham
annevk: Well afaict the pushState should set the document's current address
09:29annevk
jgraham: and presumably pushState resolves its argument against the base URL for the Document the script is associated with
09:32annevk
jgraham: when defining document base URL I don't think Hixie considered pushState
18:55jgraham
Which doesn't seem to match browsers, at least to the extent that pushState doesn't seem to affect the base URI
31 Jul 2012

would it be worth it to work around this misuse of the api so that if you reload a page that has used pushState, and the new page doesn't have an event listener for popstate, when you navigate back the browser uses the previous page (the one that used pushState) instead of staying on the current one

23:19zewt
history.pushState({}, window.title, url + "#1");
23:19zewt
i think it is (on browser back, not due to the pushState itself), but i'm not positive so i'm asking here
23:20sicking
zewt: you want it to fire when pressing "back". Not when calling pushState
23:45zewt
(since I'm in the "work around browser nits" part of my setup code for the pushState workaround)

Hixie: what happens to the pending state object if I call replaceState or pushState before onload fires?
02:45mihaip
Hixie: but then if you call pushState("bar") and then history.back() you would get a popstate event with with "foo"?
02:46Hixie
replaceState('foo'), then onload, then popstate, then pushState('bar') then history.back()?
25 Aug 2010
#whatwg
21:53jlebar
Hixie, since pushState doesn't cause a history traversal, there's no language saying that the UA should save the scroll position of the previous history entry.
21:56jlebar
At least, I forgot to do it when I implemented pushState. :)
21:56jlebar
Say you scroll down, pushState, scroll around, and then go back. Shouldn't you get the old scroll position back?
21:57Hixie
most apps i can imagine using pushState() would either not have any scroll position or would change the page so much on popstate that it'd be academic
21:58jlebar
Suppose you scroll down, pushState, then go visit some other page entirely. Then you go back to the first history entry. We should restore your scroll position, but we never saved it!
22:47Hixie
jlebar: btw re people.mozilla.org/~jlebar/respkg you can use "the document's address", pushState() doesn't change that (it changes "the document's current address")
2 Aug 2010
#whatwg
19:52jlebar
While we're bothering you, Hixie: What do you think about making the second parameter in pushState() modify document.title? Maybe that's better than the state we're in, where everyone (including, now, FF) ignores it.

Hixie: I think we're going to land pushstate soon, and although I've been saying that for a few months now, I finally have a few reviews done on it, so I think it might actually happen in the near future. It would be nice not to change it after we land it.
00:26jlebar
I can go ahead and just take out the title parameter. We certainly don't have to have the replacement specified when we land pushstate.

18 Aug 2009
#whatwg
02:05Hixie
the original intent was to only dispatch it when hitting an entry that has been pushState()d
